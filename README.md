This code works with [phpcs](http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.php.php-codesniffer.php)
and checks code against the coding standards used in CakePHP.

:warning: The `master` branch contains codesniffer rules that are based on the
PSR2 standard. If you want to check against the historical CakePHP coding
standard use any of the `1.x` releases.

## Which version should I use?
| CakePHP  | Sniffer |
| -------- | ------- |
| 2.x  | 1.0.4  |
| 3.x  | latest 3.x tag  |
| 4.x  | latest 4.0.0-beta  |

## Installation

You should install this codesniffer with composer:

    composer require --dev "cakephp/cakephp-codesniffer"
    vendor/bin/phpcs --config-set installed_paths /path/to/your/app/vendor/cakephp/cakephp-codesniffer

The second command lets `phpcs` know where to find your new sniffs. Ensure that
you do not overwrite any existing `installed_paths` value.

## Usage

Depending on how you installed the code sniffer changes how you run it. If you have
installed phpcs, and this package with PEAR, you can do the following:

    vendor/bin/phpcs --standard=CakePHP /path/to/code

:warning: Warning when these sniffs are installed with composer, ensure that
you have configured the CodeSniffer `installed_paths` setting.

## Running Tests

You can run tests with composer. Because of how PHPCS test suites work, there is
additional configuration state in `phpcs` that is required.

```bash
composer test
```

Once this has been done once, you can use `phpunit --filter CakePHP` to run the
tests for the rules in this repository.
